As we have recently used the Django admin interface the system currently thinks we are logged in. There are a few situations that could lead to us being logged out (closing the browser, restarting the DB etc.). If you find that you are getting errors creating a post referring to a lack of a logged in user, head to the admin page http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in again. This will fix the issue temporarily. There is a permanent fix awaiting you in the Homework: add security to your website! chapter after the main tutorial.

See above: the bug I'm getting is fixable. Need to look up how to handle stuff from non-logged-in users (or enable all users to login).
